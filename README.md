This contains the details, screenshots, and explanation of functionalities of the application approved under the course requirements of CMSC 127 under the BSCS program in UP Tacloban College

How to setup application:

1. Download all the files from this repository, although "CMSC 127 Technical Documentation.pdf" and "readme.md" are not required.
2. Move all files to the htdocs directory inside xampp for local webpage deployment.
3. Import the database [tennis.sql] in phpmyadmin or directly embed it into your MySQL database through the command prompt, as this will be used directly within the application
4. Open your XAMPP Panel and make sure to start your APACHE and MySQL 'Modules' under 'Actions' .
5. Open any browser, enter localhost, and browse the file location within htdocs in the search bar.
6. You now have access to freely use the application so as long as XAMPP remains open.
